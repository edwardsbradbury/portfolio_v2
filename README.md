# Codebase for https://www.edbradbury.co.uk - my personal portfolio site

This is version 2 of my portfolio. The first incarnation was coded and deployed in June 2021 and hasn't been touched since, whereas my skills have progressed.

Naturally, I'm aware that using React to build the site was overkill: the navigation bar and expanding sections could just as well have been built using HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript. However, the chances are that - had I taken that approach - I would have taken substantially more time to achieve the desired layout and styling. Using React with Material UI components enabled me to focus on considering the information I wished to convey instead of tweaking CSS rules.
